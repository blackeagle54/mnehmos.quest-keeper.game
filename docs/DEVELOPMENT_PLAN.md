## Technical Debt & Infrastructure

### Must Address
- [x] Replace text parsing with JSON parsing in frontend (dual parsing strategy implemented)
- [x] Add proper error messages to UI (CommandResult with error types)
- [ ] Implement retry logic for MCP calls
- [x] Add loading states throughout (isSyncing flags in all stores)

### Should Address
- [ ] Add test suite for parsers
- [ ] Document all tool schemas
- [ ] Performance profiling for large worlds
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

### Nice to Have
- [x] Streaming LLM responses (StreamingMessage component)
- [ ] WebSocket transport for real-time events
- [ ] Multi-client support
- [ ] Plugin system for custom rules

## Resource Allocation

### Backend (rpg-mcp)
```
Phase 1: 60% effort (Quest system critical)
Phase 2: 40% effort (POI tools)
Phase 3: 70% effort (New systems)
Phase 4: 50% effort (Combat tools)
Phase 5: 40% effort (Session tools)
Phase 6: 60% effort (Batch/Workflow)
```

### Frontend (Quest Keeper AI)
```
Phase 1: 40% effort (Quest display)
Phase 2: 60% effort (World map viz)
Phase 3: 30% effort (UI for progression)
Phase 4: 50% effort (Interactive battlemap)
Phase 5: 60% effort (Session UI)
Phase 6: 40% effort (Workflow browser)
```

### Phase 2 Complete When: ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] World map renders in viewport
- [x] POIs visible on map
- [x] Click POI → see details
- [ ] Combat at POI → battlemap transition (partial - manual transition)

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] Skills track XP and level
- [ ] Quest chains work (A unlocks B unlocks C)
- [ ] Achievements trigger on milestones
- [ ] Faction reputation affects interactions

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Quest fix takes longer | Medium | High | Timebox to 3 days, simplify if needed |
| World map performance | Low | Medium | Use LOD, chunking, virtualization |
| LLM context overflow | High | High | Priority: Context condensing |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Strict phase boundaries |
| Breaking changes in MCP | Low | High | Pin dependency versions |

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Phase 3: Progression Systems** - Begin skill system implementation
2. **Combat Log Panel** - Add combat action history display
3. **Interactive Token Movement** - Click-to-move on battlemap

### Future Priorities
1. **Context Condensing** - LLM token management for long sessions
2. **Export System** - Markdown/PDF export for adventure logs
3. **Phase 6: Workflows** - Batch generation tools
